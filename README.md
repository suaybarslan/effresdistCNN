# effresdistCNN
A simple CNN test performance on CIFAR10 dataset as a function of physical distance using human frontend. This script is designed to exemplify the findings of our recent research, which investigated the relationship between effective resolution and distance in humans. The resulting correlation has been formalized, modeled, and encapsulated into a Python function. This function serves as a scaling transformation, simulating the impact of physical distance on neuralnets employing a human's visual frontend. Please see the related paper:
